I'm a first year postgraduate student from [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/). My research interest includes inversion problem, numerical algorithm and computer science.

My interest in these areas was first aroused during my undergraduate studies at the [Yunnan University](https://www.ynu.edu.cn/) where I studied geophysical inversion, and I chose to do a final year research topic on waveform inversion. In the graduate stage, I study the application of inverse problems in industrialization. 

So far, throughout my entire research career, the impact of inverse problems has been the most profound for me, and I am also very eager to continue studying this direction.
